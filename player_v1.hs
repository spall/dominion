 Cellar â€“ You can't discard Cellar to itself, since it isn't in your
hand any longer when you resolve it. You choose what cards to
discard and discard them all at once. You only draw cards after
you have discarded. If you have to shuffle to do the drawing, the
discarded cards will end up shuffled into your new Deck.
